<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 32px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This program of commencement exercises from the 1916 Atlanta University Commencement, featured in Cleopatra Love&rsquo;s scrapbook, gives a glimpse into the state of Black intellectual thought at the time. As Marcus S. Cox argues, &ldquo;because HBCUs were centers of intellectual and political life in the black community that collaborated on initiatives, shared ideas, and duplicated efforts, one can learn a great deal about the black experience&rdquo; by studying black educational institutions (Cox 977). This particular program highlights Black art and culture (Negro National Anthem, Hiawatha), as well as wonders about the sociopolitical futurity for people of color in the United States. Featured essay titles, such as &ldquo;Social Barriers to the Survival of the Fit,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Economical and Political Future of the American Negro,&rdquo; and &ldquo;What Atlanta University has done for the Negro Race&rdquo; illustrate the wonderings and anxieties of the Black intellectual and the Black institution in the face of racial inequality.</span></p>
