<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 32px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A notable name in this graduation program is Walter Francis White (1893-1955), who graduated with Cleopatra Love and went on to become a significant Civil Rights activist.&nbsp; A 1906 race riot spurred White into activism, even though he grew up in a white-passing household. In 1916, shortly after graduating from Atlanta University, White become a founding member of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP. Later, he became an assistant secretary to the national staff of the NAACP. While civil rights activists came from a variety of backgrounds, here we see one beginning of a new wave of racial justice activism, as well as the impact of a black canon and black institutions on issues of equity.</span></p>
