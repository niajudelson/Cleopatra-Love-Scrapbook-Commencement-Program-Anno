<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 32px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The inclusion of Coleridge-Taylor&rsquo;s <em>Hiawatha</em> in the program gestures to the emerging black canon both inside and out outside of academia. Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912), along with figures such as Phyllis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Booker T. Washington, and Henry O. Tanner, came to represent Black exceptionality in a variety of mediums: music, painting, writing, education. (McGinty 200). A black opera composer from London, Coleridge-Taylor wrote <em>Hiawatha</em> in 1898. By the early 1900s, he was exceptionally popular throughout the United States. His creative success was closely followed by black American newspapers, and &ldquo;many African Americans looked upon the composure with an admiration that frequently bordered on hero worship&rdquo; (McGinty 199). Featured in this commencement ceremony, <em>Hiawatha </em>grounds the Atlanta University education in black exceptionalism and black tradition.</span></p>
